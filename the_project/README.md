# DBaaS vs DIY Postgres on GKE

Here's the pros and cons of each approach based on key differences like setup, cost, backups, etc:

## Google Cloud SQL (DBaaS)

Pros:

- Very easy to initialize.
- Backups, updates, failover, and replication are handled for you.
- Built-in backup system with daily automated backups and point-in-time recovery.
- Built in monitoring, logging, and IAM integration.
- Great for prod where reliability matters.

Cons:

- Higher ongoing cost.
- Less control over Postgres internals (extensions, etc).
- Vendor lock-in, your DB is tied to GCLoud infrastructure.

## DIY Postgres on GKE with PV

Pros:

- Full control over how Postgres is configured and deployed.
- Lower cost for smaller or non-critical workloads (e.g. dev/test)
- More portable, you're not tied to one cloud provider.

Cons:

- Setup takes more time (StatefulSets, networking, etc).
- Backups need to be implemented manually.
- You're responsible for everything- updates, scaling, maintenance, etc.

## Summary

Cloud SQL is great for teams who want to offload database operations and are okay with paying more for convenience. Running Postgres yourself on GKE gives you full control and potentially lower costs, though it comes with more responsibility.
